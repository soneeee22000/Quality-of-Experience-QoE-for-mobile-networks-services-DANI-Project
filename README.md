# Quality-of-Experience-QoE-for-mobile-networks-services-DANI-Project
The dataset Poqemon_QoE_Dataset has been used in research papers to predict QoE from network QoS metrics, and to study interactions between the many influence factors. I will also work on the same dataset to apply the right machine learning algorithm to predict Video_Streaming  and so many other tasks...

Why studying video streaming quality of experience (QoE) is important:

With the explosion of mobile devices and high-speed wireless networks, video streaming has become one of the most popular applications accounting for over 60% of internet traffic. As per Cisco's Visual Networking Index, video streaming traffic is expected to grow 4-fold from 2017 to 2022. 

Delivering high quality, uninterrupted video streaming is critical for user engagement and revenues of over-the-top (OTT) video services like YouTube, Netflix, etc. However, maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) is challenging due to factors like network congestion, protocol overhead, encoding schemes etc. 

This necessitates studying Quality of Experience (QoE) - the actual perceived experience from the user standpoint. QoE depends not just on network QoS but also on video quality, device capabilities, type of content, user expectations and context. Quantifying the impact of these influence factors through subjective studies is key.

The dataset in this project provides rich real-world data on video QoE evaluations from 181 users in mobile contexts. Modeling this data can help diagnose pain points, compare performance across conditions, and drive enhancements. Video streaming QoE optimization is crucial for continued growth of immersive, mobile video applications.

Analysis of crowdsourced datasets enables data-driven QoE management - a keyDifferentiator for next-generation wireless networks and multimedia services. This motivates our goal of analyzing this mobile video streaming QoE dataset to extract user experience insights.
